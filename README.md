 GDG-EVENT-SAMPLE
GDG GU DevFest Event Page

This repository contains the front-end code for a dynamic and visually appealing GDG DevFest event landing page. It is a single-file HTML application that utilizes native CSS for styling and includes a fully responsive design, an interactive countdown timer, a timeline agenda, and speaker cards with a 3D flip effect.

 Features

Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing.

GDG Theme Styling: Uses the iconic Google Developer Group color palette (Blue, Red, Yellow, Green) for visual elements.

Interactive Countdown: Displays the remaining time until the event begins (configurable date).

Dynamic Agenda Timeline: A responsive, vertical flowchart-style timeline showcasing the day's schedule.

3D Flip Speaker Cards: Engaging speaker section where cards flip on hover/tap to reveal session details.

Theme Toggle: A dark mode/light mode switch that persists theme preference using localStorage.

Simple Registration Form: A functional front-end form with a success message (simulated submission).

 Setup and Local Development

Since this project is contained entirely within a single index.html file and relies only on external CDNs (for fonts, icons, and Firebase), the setup is extremely simple.

Prerequisites

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

No other dependencies (like Node.js or Python) are required to view the page.

Running the Project

Save the File: Ensure the single file containing all the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is named index.html.

Open in Browser: Navigate to the file location on your computer and double-click index.html.

The page will open immediately in your default web browser.
